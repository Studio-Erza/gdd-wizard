Hi everyone, Shay from Studio Erza here.

I've decided to move GDD Wizard over to a GitHub-hosted https server, the reason being that a hosted server will allow me add features like custom templates, as well as save and template managers - which to my knowledge would've been impossible otherwise.

I would also like to announce that GDD Wizard will continue to receive updates including new features as well as bug fixes, but will remain completely free for everyone, with no separate builds locked behind paywalls. Donations are welcome, but not necessary. The previously planned "GDD Wizard Pro" will not be created, and all the features i had planned for it will simply be added to current free version.

We don't currently have any updates, but if you'd like to try the new GitHub PWA, the download now leads to that server. It can be installed as an offline app from your browser when you first visit the site.

Thank you for your time and your support. Stay tuned for more additions to GDD Wizard!
